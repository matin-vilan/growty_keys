# Growth Key Marketing - Landing Page

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This landing page project was developed with a focus on **reusability**, **maintainability**, and **speed**. The codebase follows atomic design principles with a component-based architecture that can be easily packaged and reused across multiple landing pages.

### Key Features

- âœ¨ **Reusable Components**: Built with reusability in mind, all components can be packaged and shared across multiple landing pages
- ðŸŽ¨ **Atomic Design System**: Implemented Atomic Design principles (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms) for better structure and maintainability
- ðŸš€ **AI-Enhanced Animations**: Custom animations designed with AI assistance for smooth user experience
- ðŸ“¦ **Component Library**: Ready to be packaged as a Git repository for cross-project usage
- âš¡ **Fast Development**: Optimized structure for rapid development of landing pages

### Architecture

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/       # Basic building blocks (Button, Typography, Box, Avatar)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ molecules/   # Complex components (SinLine, IPhone3D, Stats)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ organisms/   # Complete sections (Header, TrustBanner)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ animations/      # Reusable animation components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme/           # Styling and theme configuration
â””â”€â”€ app/                 # Next.js app directory
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Goals

- **Reusability**: All components are built to be reusable across different landing pages
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure following best practices
- **Speed**: Quick development of landing pages using pre-built components
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend and maintain as the project grows

## Package Future

The component library is designed to be extracted as a separate package for use across all landing pages:

```bash
# Future usage
import { Button, Typography, IPhone3D } from '@growth-key/components';
```

This will significantly speed up development for future landing pages.

## Notes

- Components follow Atomic Design principles for better organization
- Animations were created with AI assistance for optimal user experience
- Color scheme coordination with designers is needed for perfect gradient implementation
- The project was developed with limited time focused on delivering a working solution
